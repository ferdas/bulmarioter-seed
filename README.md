# BulmaRioter-seed
A simple boilerplate using [RiotJS] and [Bulma], libraries chosen for their lightness and tidiness.

In order to keep the dependencies low, Makefile was choosen to compile everything.

Useful to avoid writing the same boring part every time you start a new project.

|         | [RiotJS]  | [Bulma] |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Version | v.3.13.2  | v.0.7.4 |

### Dependencies
The system requirements to have this boilerplate running are:
  - *NodeJS* + *npm*
  - *sassc* (SASS compiler using [libsass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass))
  
The advice is to use the lastest versions of each.

### Why Makefile?
Well... I'm not a fan of the large stack often used in the frontend world. I prefer less dipendencies, less config files, less new pointless abstraction layers.
